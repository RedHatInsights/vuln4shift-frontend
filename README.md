# Vulnerability for OpenShift frontend
Red Hat Vulnerability for OpenShift service is used to assess and monitor the status of security vulnerabilities on OpenShift clusters, understand the level of exposure of infrastructure, and plan a course of action. This is the front-end repository for this service.

## First time setup
1. Make sure you have [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/) version >= 16 installed
2. Run [script to patch your `/etc/hosts`](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-proxy/blob/master/scripts/patch-etc-hosts.sh)
3. Make sure you are using [Red Hat proxy](http://hdn.corp.redhat.com/proxy.pac)

## Running locally
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Run development server with `npm run start:proxy:beta`
3. Local version of the app will be available at https://stage.foo.redhat.com:1337/preview/openshift/insights/vulnerability/

## Testing
[Cypress](https://cypress.io/) is used as the testing framework
- ```npm run test``` - run all Cypress tests
- ```npx cypress open --component``` - open Cypress in the component testing mode.
- ```npm run lint``` - run linter

## Code Coverage
1. Make sure ```npm run test``` and ```npm run test:ct``` are ran before the coverage
2. Run ```npm run coverage```

## Deploying
Any push to the following branches will trigger a build in [vuln4shift-frontend-build repository](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/vuln4shift-frontend-build) which will deploy to corresponding environment. Travis is used to deploy the application.

## Design System
This project uses [Patternfly React](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react).

## Insights Components
This app imports components from [Insights Front-end Components library](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/frontend-components). ESI tags are used to import [Insights Chrome](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-chrome) which takes care of the header, sidebar, and footer. These libraries are described in the [Platform experience documentation](http://front-end-docs-insights.apps.ocp4.prod.psi.redhat.com/).
